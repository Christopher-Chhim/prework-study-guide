## Description
Being a new coding bootcamp student inspired me to make a website to help me keep track of what I learn. I am actively learning a lot of information and it is too much for me to process and contain at once, so I was motivated to design a website where I can write notes on what I am learning. In making a website, I learned how to implement HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for web development. This helps me solve having to remember everything at once and I can implement programming languages I am currently learning. This also helped me learn and implement core coding fundamentals such as: debugging, Git branching, and having a growth mindset in the midst of developing this website.
